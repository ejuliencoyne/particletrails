I lived in the UK for all of university, from 2011 to 2015.

London isn't easy to capture in a few Instax snapshots taken sporadically over the course of a few weeks. I wasn't trying to document it in any comprehensive way, and I don't know the city well enough to feel like I could even try to do that. What came out of my instax photos is a very light map of some of the usual routes I would take through London when I lived there, the routes I wanted to retrace when I visited again. There are places I missed out on, either going to or photographing, but there are always going to be places like that when you're trying to capture somewhere close to your heart.

### Further Reading
I'm not the only one who has strong feelings about London. My two favorite blogger-documenters of London are Brenna of This Battered Suitcase and Victoria of Bridges and Balloons.
