You know what, let's expand on "lately". You might have decided to read this post because you have a headache trying to keep track of where I've been in the past few months/years, but I'm afraid I'm going to subject you to my whole life story in terms of all (or at least most of) the places I've lived and visited. Don't worry, I won't be offended if you just skip to the part you care about.

I know I'm being a bit over-the top, and the half of me that wants to make pages of lists about myself for the public to read has been fighting for days with the half of me that's embarrassed about how self-important I'm being. So let's hope those two halves balance each other out and give me just the right level of ramble here.

If you do want to skip to a section and its involved travels, they are:

<a href="#maine1">Maine; early - 2011</a> | <a href="#oxford">Oxford; 2011 - 2015</a> | <a href="#london">London; Summer 2015</a>  | <a href="#boston">Boston; 2015 - 2016</a> | <a href="#aus">Canberra; 2017</a> | <a href="#maine2">Maine; 2018 - ???</a> 

Let's jump right in!

### <a name="maine1">Maine; Early Days - 2011</a>

It is important for you to know that I am not from the "vacationland" part of Maine, where you go to sail (maybe? I actually don't really know what people do when they vacation in southern/coastal Maine) and eat lobster rolls for the summer. 

I'm from central Maine, which, if people know it at all, they know for Bangor (the second largest city in the state - it is not very large) or the University of Maine at Orono. While less famous and romantic, the area is very beautiful in its way. It's not not wild or rural, exactly, but you never need to go far to go for a walk in the woods.

Wishing to travel and live in new places from an early age, I left my hometown in the Bangor area to go to a boarding high school in northern Maine, the Maine School of Science and Mathematics. There is truly very little in Maine when you get up to Limestone, three hours north of Bangor, and close to six hours north of the nearest state border.

MSSM was an academically grueling, isolated school, with endless winters to boot. But when I think back to it, I don't remember having a bad time. (Also, winter is my favorite season.) It was a strange place, 150 nerdy teenagers plus our teachers and other staff, with nowhere to go in the middle of miles of farmland. Maybe like it should be the setting for a series of YA novels.

The most important thing was that my strange, strange high school was a crucible for some of the most solid friendships I have made, and  will probably ever make. Still, I was ready to leave when I graduated in 2011. 

### <a name="oxford">Oxford; 2011 - 2015</a>

<figure>
  <img class="image fit" src="https://i.imgur.com/fX1l9o0.jpg" alt=""/>
  <figcaption class="align-center"><em>I could only find photos of Oxford from the phone I got in my final year there. Here's the perhaps most-photographed building in Oxford, the Radcliffe Camera, as seen through the window of the Bodleian library. I think I took this around the time I was starting to get some real dread about my ability to finish my thesis.</em></figcaption>
  <br />
</figure>

It's funny that I have so few photos of a city I lived in for four years. I think when you live somewhere, there's always another time you could take pictures of this or that beautiful sight. I'm trying to change how I think about that now.

England really became my home while I was at Oxford, and I was fortunate to make friends there from all over Europe (and the world!). A close friend was from Estonia, where I visited her one summer. Another lived in Paris one year, and I got to visit him, too. Others are or have been in Germany, Switzerland, Singapore, Finland. Knowing people in so many places just makes the world feel smaller.

While I was in Oxford, Filip's (Slovenian) mother worked in Japan, and he would spend most of his longer breaks going "home" to Tokyo. We were friends at the time, not yet together, but during one break, me and two other friends went there with him, and explored Tokyo and surrounds. I had always loved travelling (clearly, since I had been driven to go abroad for university), but something new clicked on this trip. I wanted to go back, and I wanted to see more places everywhere else, too.

My time living in Oxford had ups and downs, as any time does. But something about it felt right, and I thought England might become my permanent home.  

### <a name="london">London; Summer 2015</a>

Of course, it's not so easy to move to another country. My main avenues to staying in England were further study (nixed by the terrible time I had writing that thesis - I couldn't imagine ever having to do that again, but even longer/worse) and gainful employment. So I started looking.

<figure>
  <img class="image fit" src="https://i.imgur.com/dbetFQJ.jpg" alt="Tower Bridge from the air at sunrise"/>
  <figcaption class="align-center"><em>The last time I flew into London on a student visa, the city welcomed me with an incredible sunrise view of the city.</em></figcaption>
  <br />
</figure>

I discovered, to my dismay, that as hard as it is to find jobs in general right out of university, it is significantly harder when you also need said job to sponsor you for a visa. I researched and applied, stress over my looming future interspersed with moments of joy, like graduating, seeing my family, and going on a post-graduation family trip to Scotland.

<figure>
  <img class="image fit" src="https://i.imgur.com/RI549xR.jpg" alt="Sunbeams on the Isle of Skye"/>
  <figcaption class="align-center"><em>We drove all over northern Scotland through gorgeous landscapes, like this one on the Isle of Skye.</em></figcaption>
  <br />
</figure>

If Japan had been where my deeper interest in travelling first clicked, Scotland was where it solidified. I took photos with some unknown deeper purpose, trying to catalog everything. I pored over the road atlas of Scotland I had bought. I was posessed.

When I got back to [London, where I was living with Filip for the summer][instax london], reality loomed once more. I kept applying to jobs, but when nothing had worked out by September, I knew that probably I would have to move back to the US.

Since I was going to be leaving the UK and, after going to Scotland, had realized I'd barely seen any of it, I got my butt in gear and planned a solo trip to north Wales. 

<figure>
  <img class="image fit" src="https://i.imgur.com/KU2eHPa.jpg" alt="View of mountains out a bus window in Snowdonia"/>
  <figcaption class="align-center"><em>I took a lot of infrequently-scheduled buses through more beautiful landscapes, and I didn't have to be worried other people were annoyed at the inconvenient waiting times because I was by myself! Nice!</em></figcaption>
  <br />
</figure>

It was my first (and still only, kind of) solo trip, and I learned a ton about what I like to do when seeing a new place. Let me tell you, it involves taking WAY more photos than when I'm with other people.

So, armed with the knowledge that I really actually liked seeing new places *a lot*, I moved back home.

### <a name="boston">Boston; 2015-2016</a>

So, I was actually born in Boston, but because my family moved to Maine when I was three, it didn't make the first entry in the list. I've always had family there, and it felt familiar from [visiting high school friends][boston shopping post] going to various universities in and around the city. (That's a link to my old first blog, which I left largely abandoned, but did post on one time after visiting a friend in Boston.)

I had often thought about what it would be like to have gone to school in Boston as I rode the bus from Bangor into the city on my way to visit friends or family. So when I got a job in Boston after [a short month or two in Maine][back to maine post] (old blog again) in the fall of 2015, it seemed almost predestined.

Something funny happened when I moved there, though. I've talked about how I [had some crises about not being able to travel][blogs confession] when I lived there (that's this blog, this time) because I had, oh right, a real job. So after taking a frenzy of photos in my final months in the UK, I seem to have put away my digital camera for the entirety of 2016. Almost all the photos I have of Boston are from my phone, which is fine - quite lovely, even. 

But I think something I can't really explain was a little off when I lived there, and you can kind of tell from the fact that I put my intermittent photography hobby on the shelf. Maybe it was something about starting a real adult life, combined with the political upheavals of 2016. Who can say.

  <figcaption class="align-center"><em>I lived in Jamaica Plain, and the pond was beautiful after it snowed in winter.</em></figcaption>
  <br />
</figure>

Whatever it was, it was making me feel off enough that I [decided to leave at the end of the year][postcardmhals boston] to go to Australia with Filip, both of us on work and holiday visas. His mother (formerly working in Japan, if you remember), now lived in Canberra, but 2017 would be her last full year there before she returned home to Slovenia. A year together with Filip after much of a year apart, plus being on the other side of the world from political madness, plus having a place to live in Australia for a year - that was a hard deal to pass on.

But, as an aside - I was sad to leave Boston. I would miss [the seasons][postcardmhals seasons], the streets where I lived, the routine of my commute to work. I've got my sights set on moving back, hopefully sooner rather than later.

###<a name="aus">Canberra; 2017</a>

It's a bit of an odyssey getting from almost anywhere in the western world to Australia, east coast of the US defintely included. I stopped to break up the journey in San Francisco, to stay with my good friend from high school. When I got there, I guess my photography mojo came rushing back. I took tons of pictures, [some of which were documented][postcardmhals cali] on my second ill-fated attempt at starting a blog. (The two links above, by the way, are also from there, and I think my writing is actually quite nice, if you want some further windows into this time in my life.)

[I got there][postcardmhals aus], and slowly, the anxiety I had developed from stress about work and life in Boston, and the state of the world, started to relax.

  <figcaption class="align-center"><em>Namadji National Park in the ACT. It's no joke how many kangaroos there are in Australia, especially somewhere full of parks like Canberra.</em></figcaption>
  <br />
</figure>

I settled into a quiet rhythm in Australia, doing freelance work, exploring Canberra and surrounds, and working on improving at art. I learned how to use Photoshop for digital painting, something that had intimidated me for years. I saw koalas in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, and I saw a startling collection of bonsai trees at the National Arboretum. I got used to seeing Telstra Tower in the distance. I started learning a little bit about Aboriginal peoples at the National Museum. I played a lot of the X-Wing Miniatures game at the many weekly game nights around Canberra. 

When I first started telling people that I was moving to Australia for the year, everyone asked if I was excited to live in Sydney, as though the city and the country were synonymous. People occasionally did this with London too, when I was at university ("How do you like living in London?" "Oh, I actually live in Oxford!" "Oh right, aren't those close though?" "Well, yes, but they are different cities..."), but at least London is close enough for the typical east coast American to imagine. Except for a few people I knew, who had a fascination with the country or family who lived there (or both), Australia was so far away that it became a blob in their minds consisting of Uluru and the Sydney Opera House.

Sydney wasn't too far away, just a 3-and-a-half hour bus ride north, and I first got to visit in early March for Mardi Gras. 

I was charmed by Sydney, certainly. But most cities take a little while to grow on me
