You know what, let's expand on "lately". You might have decided to read this post because you have a headache trying to keep track of where I've been in the past few months/years, but I'm afraid I'm going to subject you to my whole life story in terms of all (or at least most of) the places I've lived and visited.

Don't worry too much, though. I know I'm being a bit over-the top, and the half of me that wants to make pages of lists about myself for the public to read has been fighting for days with the half of me that's embarrassed/disgusted at how self-important I'm being. So let's hope those two halves balance each other out and give me just the right level of ramble here.

Let's jump right in! (Or, if you're just trying to catch up, you can skip down to the end!)

### Maine; Early Days - 2011

### Oxford; 2011 - 2015

### London; Summer 2015

### Boston; 2015-2016

So I was actually born in Boston, but because my family moved to Maine when I was three, it didn't make the list. 

### Canberra; 2017

### Maine; 2018 - ???
